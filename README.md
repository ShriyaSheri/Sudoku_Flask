### **Sudoku Solver Project Overview**

This web-based **Sudoku Solver** is an interactive platform that allows users to play and solve Sudoku puzzles directly from their browser. The system is designed to generate random puzzles, verify solutions, offer hints, and maintain user rankings based on puzzle-solving performance. It has a visually appealing interface that guides the user through solving the puzzle while ensuring compliance with Sudoku rules.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Random Puzzle Generation**:
   - The platform generates random Sudoku puzzles using Python. The puzzles are of varying difficulty levels and always have a valid solution. This ensures that every game offers a new and engaging challenge.

2. **Solution Verification**:
   - The core of the system is powered by a **backtracking algorithm**, which ensures that the puzzles are solvable and checks if the user’s solution is correct. Once the player submits their solution, the algorithm runs in the background and verifies whether it adheres to Sudoku rules.

3. **Real-time Error Detection**:
   - The system actively monitors the user’s inputs and detects errors such as duplicate numbers within rows, columns, or 3x3 grids. If an invalid number is entered, it highlights the mistake in real time, helping the user avoid breaking Sudoku rules.

4. **Hint System**:
   - If a player gets stuck, they can use the **hint feature** to either fill a correct number into the grid or highlight potential candidate numbers. This feature helps beginners or players who are struggling with difficult puzzles to progress without frustration.

5. **User Accounts and Ranking System**:
   - The system supports multiple user accounts, allowing each user to log in and maintain personalized progress. Based on the number of puzzles solved and the time taken to complete them, the platform tracks user performance and maintains a **ranking system**. This feature encourages competitiveness and provides a sense of accomplishment for players who consistently solve puzzles quickly.

6. **Timer and Statistics**:
   - Each game session includes a **timer** that tracks how long a player takes to solve a puzzle. After completing a puzzle, the time taken and the number of attempts are recorded. This data is used to compare performance across users.

7. **Interactive and User-friendly Interface**:
   - The front-end of the project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a **clean and responsive design**. The Sudoku grid is easy to interact with, and users can input numbers directly into the grid while receiving instant feedback for errors or duplicate numbers.
